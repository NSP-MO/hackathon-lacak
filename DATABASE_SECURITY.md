# Database Security Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented for the LACAK blockchain system's integration with Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Security Features

### 1. Encryption at Rest
- **Neon Native Encryption**: All data stored in Neon is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
- **Hash Storage**: All sensitive hashes (verification_hash, label_hash, blockchain_anchor_hash) are stored as encrypted text fields
- **No Plain Text Secrets**: Verification secrets and blockchain secrets are never stored in the database

### 2. Encryption in Transit
- **TLS/SSL**: All connections to Neon database use TLS 1.2+ encryption
- **Connection String Security**: Database URLs are stored as environment variables, never in code

### 3. Access Control
- **Environment Variables**: Database credentials are managed through Vercel environment variables
- **Least Privilege**: Database user has only necessary permissions for CRUD operations
- **No Direct Access**: Application layer is the only interface to the database

### 4. Data Integrity
- **Immutable Audit Trail**: Audit logs are append-only with no update or delete operations
- **Blockchain Verification**: All verification events are anchored to blockchain for tamper-proof records
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Referential integrity enforced at database level
- **Check Constraints**: Status fields are validated at database level

### 5. Hash Security Best Practices
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: All hashes use SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm
- **Salted Hashes**: Verification hashes include secret pepper (VERIFICATION_SECRET)
- **Unique Constraints**: All hash fields have unique constraints to prevent duplicates
- **Indexed Lookups**: Hash fields are indexed for fast, secure lookups

### 6. Query Security
- **Parameterized Queries**: All database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript types ensure type-safe database operations
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before database operations

### 7. Audit and Monitoring
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All verification attempts are logged with timestamps and IP hashes
- **IP Privacy**: User IP addresses are hashed (SHA-256) before storage
- **Immutable Records**: Audit logs cannot be modified or deleted
- **Timestamp Tracking**: All records include created_at and updated_at timestamps

## Database Schema Security

### Product Codes Table
\`\`\`sql
- label_hash: UNIQUE, indexed (prevents duplicate codes)
- verification_hash: UNIQUE, indexed (fast secure lookups)
- blockchain_anchor_hash: indexed (blockchain verification)
- status: CHECK constraint (only valid states allowed)
\`\`\`

### Blockchain Blocks Table
\`\`\`sql
- hash: UNIQUE, indexed (prevents duplicate blocks)
- merkle_root: indexed (Merkle tree verification)
- events: JSONB (flexible, validated event storage)
\`\`\`

### Audit Logs Table
\`\`\`sql
- id: UUID (globally unique identifiers)
- timestamp: indexed DESC (fast recent log queries)
- ip_hash: SHA-256 hashed (privacy protection)
- No UPDATE or DELETE operations (immutability)
\`\`\`

## Environment Variables Required

\`\`\`bash
NEON_NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database?sslmode=require
LACAK_VERIFICATION_SECRET=your-verification-secret
LACAK_BLOCKCHAIN_SECRET=your-blockchain-secret
\`\`\`

## Security Checklist

- [x] All data encrypted at rest (Neon native)
- [x] All connections use TLS/SSL
- [x] Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- [x] Hash fields use SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm
- [x] Secrets stored as environment variables only
- [x] Audit trail is immutable (append-only)
- [x] IP addresses are hashed for privacy
- [x] Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity
- [x] Check constraints validate data at database level
- [x] Unique constraints prevent duplicate hashes
- [x] Indexes optimize secure lookups
- [x] TypeScript types ensure type safety

## Migration and Deployment

### Initial Setup
1. Run `scripts/001-create-tables.sql` to create database schema
2. Verify all tables, indexes, and constraints are created
3. Test with sample data to ensure security measures are working

### Data Migration (if needed)
1. Export existing data from in-memory store
2. Validate all hashes before import
3. Import data using batch operations
4. Verify data integrity after migration

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Audits
- Review audit logs for suspicious patterns
- Monitor failed verification attempts
- Check for unusual IP hash patterns
- Verify blockchain integrity regularly

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query performance on indexed fields
- Check database connection pool usage
- Review slow query logs
- Optimize indexes as needed

## Compliance

This implementation follows security best practices for:
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Access control and authentication
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Data integrity and validation
